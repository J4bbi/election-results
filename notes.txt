The first two lines give the ward name, the number of candidates, number of seats,
the number of lines of vote data that follow, the electorate and the total number of votes cast.

There is then a line for each candidate, with party, and an indicators of whether elected (1) or not (0).

There are then many, in this case 1022, vote data lines, indicating how many voters opted for each order of preference.

The first and last of these lines are shown here, indicating that 35 voters gave first preference to
Bangor-Jones with no further preference; and that just one voter gave preference order Taylor, Sinclair,
Simpson, O'Hanrahan, Munro, Morrison, Bangor-Jones, Currie.

[The 0s at the end of each line and on the final line are just "end of data" indicators.]
